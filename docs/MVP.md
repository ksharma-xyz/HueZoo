## Core Idea

**The Threshold** — detect the smallest color difference you can. One miss, game over.
**Daily Challenge** — date-seeded puzzle, same for every player, 1 attempt per day.

---

## User Journey

```
Open app
  ├── Daily Challenge card  →  1 attempt/day  →  Result  →  Share
  └── The Threshold card    →  5 attempts / 8 hours
                                  ├── Out of tries → Watch Ad (+1) OR Unlock $2 forever
                                  └── Result → Leaderboard → Share
```

---

## Monetization

| Feature | Free | Paid ($2 one-time) |
|---|---|---|
| Daily Challenge | ✅ 1/day | ✅ 1/day |
| The Threshold attempts | 5 per 8 hours | ♾️ Unlimited |
| Watch ad for +1 try | ✅ | Not needed |
| Submit to leaderboard | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ads | ✅ shown | ❌ removed |

**Attempt window: 5 tries per 8 hours** (3 windows per day — more engagement than midnight reset).
`next_reset_at` stored as ISO timestamp in SQLDelight, not date string.

**Push toward $2 purchase:**
- Persistent "Unlock" button in Home top-right — always visible
- After 3rd try used: "X of 5 tries left" counter on Threshold card
- After 5th try: Paywall sheet slides up automatically
- Paywall: `HuezooButton` primary = "Unlock Forever — $2", ghost secondary = "Watch Ad (+1 try)"
- After purchase: remove attempt cap, hide ads, show "Unlimited" badge on Threshold card

- [ ] 4.8 Show remaining attempts count during game

### Phase 5 — Daily Challenge Game
- [ ] 5.1 `DailyViewModel` — load `seededColorForDate(today)` as base

### Phase L — Font Licenses (before App Store submission)
- [ ] L.1 **Clash Display (Fontshare FF EULA)** — review full license at `Downloads/ClashDisplay_Complete/License/FFL.txt`. License explicitly permits "Mobile, Digital, Apps" commercial use. Verify bundling fonts inside an APK/IPA is acceptable under clause 01. If any concern: replace Clash Display with **DM Serif Display** or **Syne** (both SIL OFL, no restrictions).
- [ ] L.2 **Bebas Neue (SIL OFL 1.1)** — no action needed. OFL permits bundling in any software including commercial apps.
- [ ] L.3 **Space Grotesk (SIL OFL 1.1)** — no action needed.
- [ ] L.4 **Antonio (SIL OFL 1.1)** — no action needed (kept in font folder but no longer used in Typography.kt — can be removed).
- [ ] L.5 **Fredoka (SIL OFL 1.1)** — no action needed (same as above — kept but replaced by Clash Display).
- [ ] L.6 Add font attribution to app's "About" or Settings screen if required (Clash Display: "Designed by Indian Type Foundry").
